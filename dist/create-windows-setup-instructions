Instructions for creating a windows package for q:

1. Prepare the environment:

	a. Drive Q: needs to point to the source code folder (use VirtualBox's shared folder or checkout from it and map it to Q:)

	b. Create C:\q-build-environment folder 

	c. Install the following:

		1. Python 2.7 (32 bit) - Make sure to add python.exe to the path in the installation instructions
		2. Pywin32 - pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.exe (make sure it's 32 bit)
		3. PyInstaller 2.1 (Extract the zip file into c:\q-build-environment\ so the files will reside in c:\q-build-environment\PyInstaller-2.1\)
		4. NSIS - nsis-2.46-setup.exe (into c:\q-build-environment\nsis)

2. Go to q:\dist and remove the folder

3. Remove the folder win_output, win_build and any setup*.exe files from q:\dist

4. Run the following to compile q.exe:

	python.exe c:\q-build-environment\PyInstaller-2.1\pyinstaller.py -F --distpath=win_output --workpath=win_build q:\bin\q

	output will reside in win_output\

5. Run the following in order to package it to an installer:

	Make sure to set the version number properly - Note that windows requires versions to be in the format X.X.X.X

	c:\q-build-environment\nsis\makensis.exe -DVERSION=<version-number> q-TextAsData-with-path.nsi

	setup.exe will reside in the current folder

6. Rename the file to the proper version:

	ren q:\dist\setup.exe q:\dist\setup-<version-number>.exe

7. Put the file in the packages-for-q repository
