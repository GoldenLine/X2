Instructions to bump the version of q in homebrew

1. Sync your fork with homebrew original fork

	git checkout master

	git pull upstream master

	git push origin master

2. Create a branch for the version bump

	git checkout -b q<version-number>

3. Edit the file Library/Formula/q.rb.

	a. Change the url to the new tar.gz file:

	b. Change the sha1 checksum

		$ wget "https://github.com/harelba/q/archive/<version>.tar.gz"

		$ sha1sum <version>.tar.gz
		<checksum> <filename>

		$ Change the checksum in q.rb's "sha1" line to the new checksum

	c. Verify by running the following:

		delete the <version>.tar.gz file from the folder

		$ s=`curl -L \`grep url q.rb | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"'\` | sha1sum | awk '{print $1}'`

		$ echo $s
		<checksum>
		
		$ grep $s *.rb

		The output should contain (and only contain) the sha1 line in q.rb

4. Check the diff

	git diff | vi -

5. Commit the change

6. Push it as a separate branch to your repository:

	git push origin q<version-number>

7. Go the homebrew fork in github, and press "compare and pull-request" on the just-pushed branch

8. Review the diff and make sure that the pull-request is from <fork>/<branch> to homebrew/master (should be the default)

9. Press "create pull-request" button

10. If everything is fine, you'll be confirmed after several hours
