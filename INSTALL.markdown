# q - Treating Text as a Database 

## Requirements
* Just Python 2.5 and up or Python 2.4 with sqlite3 module installed.

## Installation
* Mac users can use homebrew to install q - Just run `brew install q` (Thanks @stuartcarnie)
* RPM Packaging is ready. You can download the RPM from the link below.
* Debian Packaging will come soon.

    __**Latest version `1.3.0`**__
    
    **RPM of the latest version** - Can be downloaded **[here](https://github.com/harelba/packages-for-q/raw/master/rpms/q-1.3.0-1.noarch.rpm)**. The RPM package also includes a man page. Just enter `man q`

    **Manual installation of the latest version** - Download the main q executable from **[here](https://raw.github.com/harelba/q/1.3.0/q)** into a folder in the path and make the file executable


    __**Previous version is `1.2.0`**__
    
    **RPM of the previous version** - Can be downloaded **[here](https://github.com/harelba/packages-for-q/raw/master/rpms/q-1.2.0-1.noarch.rpm)**. Includes man page. Just enter `man q`

    **Manual installation of the previous version** - If for some reason you need the previous version, you can download the main q executable from **[here](https://raw.github.com/harelba/q/1.2.0/q)** into a folder in the path and make the file executable. Please notify me of any such case, so I can understand the reason and fix things if needed.

**NOTE:** If you're using Python 2.4, then you will have to install the sqlite3 package for q to work.

q supports an option file in ~/.qrc or in the working directory (with the name .qrc) which provides defaults for some or all of the command line options. A sample .qrc file with commented-out options is included. Just put it in your home folder and modify it according to your needs.
