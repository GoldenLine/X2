# q - Bring the power of SQL to the Linux Command Line

## Overview
This script allows performing SQL-like statements on tabular text data. It's purpose is to bring SQL expressive power to manipulating text data using the Linux command line. Have you ever looked at a text file and wandered how easy would it be if this was a database table and not a text file?

## Requirements
* Python with the sqlite3 module installed. Python 2.5 and up contain this module.

## Usage Examples
* This example demonstrates how we can use this script to do some calculation on tabular data. We'll use the output of ls as the input data (we're using --full-time so the output format will be the same on all machines).
  * Execute the following command. It will create out test data:
```bash
ls -ltrd --full-time * > mydatafile
```
